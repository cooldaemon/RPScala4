Version Control

sbt creates and uses several directories that you will normally want to exclude from version control:

  target/
  lib_managed/
  project/boot/
  project/build/target/
  project/plugins/target/
  project/plugins/lib_managed/
  project/plugins/src_managed/

A .gitignore for an sbt project should contain these entries:

  target/
  lib_managed/
  src_managed/
  project/boot/
